# Sorting
Sorting Algorithms
Overview
Here I’ll be uploading different sorting algorithms implemented in C and Python. The goal is to practice, learn, and build a small reference of classic sorting techniques like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and more as I keep adding them.
Contribution
I’m still in my learning phase, so the code may not always be perfect. If you spot mistakes, improvements, or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request — I’d really appreciate the feedback!
What to Expect
- Simple and clear implementations
- Focus on understanding the logic rather than heavy optimization
- More algorithms will be added over time
